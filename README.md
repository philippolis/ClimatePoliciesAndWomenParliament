# Abstract
How does greater influence of women affect the action against climate change? The following analysis tries to answer this question by looking at how well different countries perform in issuing climate change policies dependent on what percentage of women are in positions of power, approximated here as the percentage of women in parliament.

# Data
This analysis combines data from the Inter‐Parliamentary Union on the [percentage women in national parliaments](http://archive.ipu.org/wmn-e/world-arc.htm) around the world (Inter‐Parliamentary Union 2021) and data from the [Climate Change Performance Index](https://germanwatch.org/en/CCPI) published annually by Germanwatch (Burck et al. 2017, 2018, 2019). For the analysis, data for the years 2018 to 2020 was combined and only the Policy Performance part of the Climate Change Performance Index was used, as this is were individual influence is greatest.

# Results
This analysis shows that with a 90%‐credible interval we can expect a 0.61 point‐ to a 1.18 point‐increase in climate policy performance per extra percentage‐point of women in parliament. Thus, this analysis supports the call for increased attention to the interplay of gender and climate change.
